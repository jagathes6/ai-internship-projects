# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project performs customer segmentation on the Mall Customers Dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to identify different customer groups based on Annual Income and Spending Score.

## Steps
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset.
2. Selected relevant features and standardized them.
3. Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Applied K-Means clustering with the chosen K value.
5. Visualized the clusters and centroids.
6. Exported the dataset with cluster labels.

## Key Insight
The dataset forms approximately five meaningful customer groups, such as high-income low-spending customers, high-income high-spending customers, and low-income low-spending customers. These clusters can support marketing and business decisions.
