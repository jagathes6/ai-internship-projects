# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This mini-project applies **K-Means clustering** to group mall customers based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The dataset is preprocessed, scaled, and visualized to understand different customer types.

### ✔️ What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
- Used **Elbow Method** to find best K  
- Applied **K-Means (K = 5)**  
- Visualized clusters with centroids  

### ✔️ Key Insight
Customers clearly form 5 groups such as high-income low-spenders, low-income low-spenders, and high-income high-spenders — useful for targeted marketing.
