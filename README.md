# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project builds a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The objective is to train a simple model that can correctly identify digits from 0 to 9.

## Steps
1. Loaded the MNIST dataset and examined sample images.
2. Normalized and reshaped the data for model training.
3. Built a classification model using a neural network.
4. Trained the model on the training set and evaluated accuracy.
5. Tested the model on unseen images.
6. Observed prediction performance and error cases.

## Key Insight
The model achieves strong accuracy on handwritten digit recognition and demonstrates effective learning of digit patterns. Further improvements can be made using deeper neural networks or CNNs.
